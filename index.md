## Twitch Data Analysis

In this project, I formatted and analyzed a dataset of the Top 1000 Streamers on Twitch in 2020. I found my dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata) Then from there, I created a SQL server on Google Cloud Platform and connected to it using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

After connecting it I used a simple SQL Query to create a database named 'twitch' 
```
CREATE DATABASE twitch;
```

From the Object Explorer in MSSQL, I selected the 'twitch' database and selected task, then imported a flat file. I then select the path to where I had downloaded the CSV and imported it. This automatically created a table with the necessary columns which I named 'topStreamers'. To make sure that everything worked correctly I used the following query to display the table.

```
select * from topStreamers	
```

I played around with the data and tried different ways of organizing it. I found the `top` clause in SQL to be pretty useful to find the leading groups of streamers depending on what I had filtered it with. Apparently, 'top' is only used in MSSQL, so I found that to be interesting as it seems pretty useful. 


```
select top 20 Channel,Average_viewers	  -- top 20 streamers ordered by average viewer
from topStreamers	 
order by Average_viewers desc;
```
```
select top 10 Channel,Followers,Language  -- top 10 english streamers
from topStreamers
where Language = 'English'
order by Followers desc;
```
```
select top 10 Channel,Followers,Language -- top 10 japanese streamers
from topStreamers 
where Language = 'Japanese'
order by Followers desc;
```

Another useful syntax I found was `distinct` this automatically removes duplicate values so I used it to find all the different languages that the Top 1000 Streamers were streaming in. 


```
select distinct Language  -- find all languages used by top 1000 streamers
from topStreamers
```

I wanted to find out how many of each streamer was streaming in a certain language so I used `count` to display the amount for each language out of the 1000 Streamers. I will be using these values later to confirm other calculations.


```
select count (Language) as Amount, Language -- amount of streamers streaming in different languages
from topStreamers
group by Language	
order by Amount desc;
```

After spending some time using SQL, I wanted to gain more experience using different tools often used by data scientsts. I researched and read that Python with pandas and matplotlib were very commonly used. Juptyer Notebooks was also a commonly used tool as well, and to incorporate all of these together I used my preferred IDE of choice, VS Code. But to make my SQL Server not go to waste I went one step further and connected to that from python.
